#Wiki Sports
##Project 2

For this project I decided to create a wiki website about sports.
Articles can be added and stored into categories.
Each article has the ability to be edited and saved.


###User Story
A user can create a new article and save it to a category

Any user can then access the article through various methods including: search bar, recently added, categories

A user can edit the posted article and save the edited version
